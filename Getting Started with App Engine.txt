##GCP Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

#Task 1: Initialize App Engine
1.Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
   gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

2.Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

  git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

3.Navigate to the source directory:
 
  cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Task 2: Run Hello World application locally

1.Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

  sudo apt-get update

2.Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.
Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.  

   sudo apt-get install virtualenv
   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   
3.Activate the virtual environment.

  source venv/bin/activate

4.Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

  pip install  -r requirements.txt

5.Run the application:

  python main.py

##Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

1.Navigate to the source directory:
  
  cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2.Deploy your Hello World application.

  gcloud app deploy

3.Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
 
  gcloud app browse
