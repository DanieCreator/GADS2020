#GETTING STARTED WITH CLOUD SHELL & GCLOUD

#To complete this lab, you need:

#Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
#Time to complete the lab.
#Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab.

#1.Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. 
On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.

#2.Copy the username, and then click Open Google Console.
 The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.If you see the Choose an account page, click Use Another Account.

#3.Start Cloud Shell
Open a Cloud Shell session by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the Cloud Console:

console_topbar_icon_cloudshell.png

Then Click Continue:

After Cloud Shell is activated you can use the command line to invoke the Cloud SDK gcloud command or other tools available on the virtual machine instance.
 Later in the lab you will use your $HOME directory, which is used in persistent disk storage to store files across projects and between Cloud Shell sessions.
 Your $HOME directory is private to you and cannot be accessed by other users.
 
 #UNDERSTANDING REGIONS AND ZONES
Certain Compute Engine resources live in regions or zones.
 A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources.
 Each region has one or more zones. For example, the us-central1 region denotes a region in the Central United States that has zones 
 us-central1-a,
 us-central1-b, 
 us-central1-c, 
 and us-central1-f.

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone.
 To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance,
 the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.

#Default regions and zones are set by using the following values:

                      google-compute-default-zone google-compute-default-region

#To see what your default region and zone settings are, run the following gcloud command, 
replacing <your_project_id> which you can see on the Home page in the Console or look in the Qwiklabs tab where you started this lab, 
with your Project ID:	

                      gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>

#INITIALIZING CLOUD SDK

The gcloud CLI is a part of the Cloud SDK. You need to download and install the SDK on your own system and initialize it 
(by running 'gcloud init') before you can use the 'gcloud' command-line tool.

The gcloud CLI is automatically available in Cloud Shell. Since you're using Cloud Shell for this lab,
 you don't need to install gcloud manually	
 
#Setting environment variables
Environment variables are variables that define your environment. 
Define your own variables and save yourself time when writing scripts that contain APIs or executables.

#Make a couple of environment variables:

       export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>

#Set your ZONE environment variable (use the value for zone from the earlier command):

       export ZONE=<your_zone>	   
	   
#Verify that your variables were set properly:
            
			echo $PROJECT_ID
            echo $ZONE
			
			
#CREATE A VIRTUAL MACHINE WITH GCLOUD

#Create a virtual machine with gcloud
Create a new virtual machine instance using gcloud. In the following command you'll use:

gcloud compute which enables you to easily manage your Compute Engine resources in a friendlier format than using the Compute Engine API.
instances create creates a new instance.

#Run the following to create your vm:

               gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE

The name of the vm is "gcelab2",
You're using the --machine-type flag to specify the machine type as "n1-standard-2"
You're using the --zone flag to specify that it gets created in the zone you defined with your environment variable.


#USING GCLOUD COMMANDS

#Run the following command in Cloud Shell to obtain help:
    
	 gcloud -h
	 gcloud config --help
	 gcloud help config
	 
Use the Enter key or the Spacebar to scroll through the help content
Type q to exit the content

#gcloud Global Flags govern the behavior of commands on a per-invocation level. Flags override any values set in SDK properties.

#View the list of configurations in your environment:

     gcloud config list

#To check how other properties are set, see all properties by calling:

     gcloud config list --all

#List your components:

     gcloud components list


#AUTO-COMPLETION
gcloud interactive has auto prompting for commands and flags, and displays inline help snippets in the lower section as the command is typed.

Static information, like command and sub-command names, and flag names and enumerated flag values, are auto-completed using dropdown menus.	 

#Install the beta components:

      sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

#Enter the gcloud interactive mode:

      gcloud beta interactive

*****When using the interactive mode, click on the Tab key to complete file path and resource arguments. 
If a dropdown menu appears,use the Tab key to move through the list, and the Space bar to select your choice.******

#Try it out! Start typing the following command, using auto-complete to finish the command:
       gcloud compute instances describe <your_vm>


#SSH INTO YOUR VM INSTANCE
gcloud compute makes connecting to your instances easy. The gcloud compute ssh command provides a wrapper around SSH,
 which takes care of authentication and the mapping of instance name to IP address.	 

#Use gcloud compute ssh to SSH into your vm:

     gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE
	 
Type "Y" to continue:
     Do you want to continue? (Y/n)

Press the Enter key through the passphrase section to leave the passphrase empty.

     Generating public/private rsa key pair.
     Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase) 
	 
#You don't need to do anything here, so disconnect from SSH by exiting from the remote shell by typing "exit":
      exit


#USE THE HOME DIRECTORY
Now try out your Home directory. The contents of your Cloud Shell Home directory persists across projects between all Cloud Shell sessions,
 even after the virtual machine terminates and is restarted.

#Change your current working directory:
    cd $HOME

#Open your .bashrc configuration file using vi text editor:
    vi ./.bashrc
